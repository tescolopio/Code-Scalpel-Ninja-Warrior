# Stage 4: The Confidence Crisis

Uncertainty quantification torture tests for Code Scalpel, built from the *Code Scalpel Ninja Warrior* specification. Each obstacle is isolated in its own folder with:

- Minimal code samples that exercise the obstacle
- Ground-truth or ambiguity expectations
- Execution and evidence notes tailored to Code Scalpel output (confidence, limitations, contradictions)

## Obstacles

1. **4.1 Calibration Test** – Compare reported confidence against known ground truth buckets.
2. **4.2 Adversarial Naming** – Verify semantics beat naming and comments.
3. **4.3 Duplicate Function Dilemma** – Require explicit acknowledgment of ambiguous targets.
4. **4.4 Incomplete Information Acknowledgment** – Force clear disclosure of unanalyzable dependencies.
5. **4.5 Confidence Decay Test** – Ensure inference chains lower confidence monotonically.
6. **4.6 Contradiction Detector** – Flag conflicting evidence and prefer runtime behavior over claims.

See each obstacle folder for the exact artifacts and expected evidence to collect.
